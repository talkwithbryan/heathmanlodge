# README

This is my first project using Rails. I work with a [Vancouver WA hotel][http://www.heathmanlodge.com] and am hoping to build our next site using 
Ruby on Rails. It's my hope that I'll be able to take the website in a whole new direction and increase the quality and SEO by working on it with
this system.

For most of the sites that my team and I build, we use various Wordpress themes, but I am experimenting on Rails as I am beginning to learn the
language. My goal is to A/B test this site against some of our others as to how it indexes and ranks when the search engines pick it up. As a
premiere hotel in Vancouver and a beautiful hotel near Portland, we want to make sure that people can find our
event space, as well as our restaurant, http://www.hudsonsbarandgrill.com.

Normally, I am the content writer for the [blog][http://blog.heathmanlodge.com] but I also do some work with the website design, and I want to
increase what I am doing in that regard.

## Hotels in Vancouver, WA - a tough vertical

I've been working with the Heathman Lodge to increase their website ranking through great content, and that is very important. Now, we're going to
increase our keyword linking strategy. In such a tough market, it's important to concentrate and get this done.
